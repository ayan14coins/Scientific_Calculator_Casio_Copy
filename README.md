# Scientific-Calculator-built-with-html-js-css

Making a Casio scientific calculator from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a web project.

## Description

This web project is a browser-based scientific calculator inspired by the classic **Casio** design, built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It aims to simulate the appearance and functionality of a real Casio calculator as closely as possible.

The calculator supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including standard arithmetic, trigonometric functions, exponentiation, and more. The interface is carefully designed to mimic the layout and feel of a physical scientific calculator, offering an intuitive experience for users familiar with the original device.

Key features include:

- Realistic Casio-like button layout and design  
- Keyboard interaction support  
- Customizable background themes  
- Sound effects for button feedback  
- Cursor navigation for editing expressions  
- Copy-and-paste functionality in place of Shift and Alpha keys  

While most core functions are implemented, a few advanced features such as log with arbitrary base, x/y, Sâ‡”D, RCL, and hyp are still in progress due to their complexity. The project remains open for improvement and contributions.

Whether you're a student, developer, or enthusiast, this project serves as a fun and practical example of front-end development and functional UI design.
